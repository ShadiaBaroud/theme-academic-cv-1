abstract = {Mobile shopping (m-shopping) turns out to be exceptionally important for both retail-selling and marketing. Although for the past few years m-shopping has increasingly become an alternative approach to buying products, the consumer's expectation for high quality services is not clearly fulfilled yet. It is extremely significant to fully understand and analyze the factors which affect the acceptance of consumers for m-shopping, especially for the purpose of mobilizing the right strategies for the respective vendors. This literature review focuses on finding the factors that influence m- shopping that particularly reflect the consumers attitude and purchasing behavior in performing such kind of e-commerce activity. Our findings identify 20 influencing factors that are considered important for improving the quality of services in m-shopping.},

abstract = {Threats to information systems security have become very alarming with the present extensive growth in Internet use. As a response, intrusion detection systems have been created to provide defence mechanisms against various types of attacks such as those due to Ransomware, DdoS, Botnet, Trojans, Viruses, Spyware, Worms, and more. The use of a machine learning approach to develop smart intrusion detection systems to solve these types of problem have also been explored and this typically involves applying the various machine learning techniques that focus on the dataset collected by a network monitoring tool. This paper presents a study on the utility of three classification machine learning algorithms which are J48, Decision Stump, and Random Forest in detecting threats by comparing their accuracy and processing time when applied to the UNSW-NB15 dataset with the aim of discovering the best technique that can accurately spot the pattern of any suspicious activity in the network. The results of show that J48 exhibits the best combination of accuracy and processing time among the evaluated classification techniques on the employed dataset. Moreover, the study reveals that increasing the sample size of the dataset can enhance the precision of the model, although this enhancement might come at the expense of overall accuracy. Additionally, it emphasizes that the application of feature selection techniques alone does not necessarily lead to an improvement in accuracy.},

abstract = {Software Testing Ontology (STO) serves as a formal representation of the vocabulary to be used in descriptions pertaining to software testing knowledge area. The need for a standardized STO is crucial in making descriptions of various aspects of software testing body of knowledge and practices not only machine processable, but also can be done in a uniform way. This paper describes the steps we have used to build the base for the standard STO that, in turn, can be extended and further enhanced towards standardization. The evolving STO is envisioned to be an important addition towards enriching the functionality of semantic software testing tools and systems.},

abstract = {Abstract Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) within Industry 4.0 has propelled the evolution of fault diagnosis and predictive maintenance (PdM) strategies, marking a significant shift towards smarter maintenance paradigms in the mechatronics sector. With the advent of Industry 4.0, mechatronic systems have become increasingly sophisticated, highlighting the critical need for advanced maintenance methodologies that are both efficient and effective. This paper delves into the confluence of cutting-edge AI techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), with multi-agent systems (MAS) to enhance fault diagnosis precision and facilitate PdM in the context of Industry 4.0. Specifically, we explore the use of various ML models, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests (RFs), and DL architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which have been effectively oriented to analyses complex industrial data. Initially, the study examines the progress in AI algorithms that accelerate fault identification by leveraging data from system operations, sensors, and historical trends. AI-enabled fault diagnosis rapidly detects irregularities and discerns the fundamental causes, thereby minimizing downtime and enhancing system reliability and efficiency. Furthermore, this paper underscores the adoption of AI-driven PdM approaches, emphasizing prognostics that predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of machinery. This predictive capability allows for the strategic scheduling of maintenance activities, optimizing resource use, prolonging the lifespan of expensive assets, and refining the management of spare parts inventory. The tangible advantages of employing AI for fault diagnosis and PdM are showcased through a case study from authentic mechatronics implementations. This case study highlights successful implementations, documenting real-world challenges such as data integration issues and system interoperability, and elaborates on the strategies deployed to navigate these obstacles. The results demonstrate improved operational reliability and cost savings and shed light on the pragmatic considerations and solutions that facilitate the adoption of AI and MAS in industrial applications. The paper also navigates the challenges and prospective research avenues in applying AI within the mechatronics domain of Industry 4.0, setting the stage for ongoing innovation and exploration in this transformative domain.},

From the standpoint of the manufacturer, warranty can help the company make more money and improve its reputation. From the customer's perspective, warranty is seen as a dependable indicator to quality assurance (QA). The aim of this paper is to gain some initial insights on spare part analytics which is important for the development of any smart maintenance system in this new industrial era. We do this by first focusing on only one important aspect, which is warranty. This results in a discussion on some possible challenges that can be adopted in dealing with difficult issues related to spare parts warranty such as handling claims during the warranty period.},

abstract = {CBR is a reasoning paradigm that instead of relying on general rules or models chooses the specific knowledge contained into already solved instances of problems. The quality of case-based reasoning method depends primarily on a good representation of cases in the retrieve step and the richness of knowledge base. The basis for using the case-based reasoning process is to support the formalization of reasoning procedures for collaborative medical acts. We proposed an approach is to help resolving the difficulty of determining the best treatment for the disease and to get best practices. This research describes a model for knowledge engineering using the taxonomic reasoning of ontology modeling and semantic similarity to . In addition to being a valuable support in the procedure of medical decision making, this model can be used to strengthen significant collaborations and traceability that are important for the development of proper deployment of medical applications. Adequate mechanisms for information management with traceability of the reasoning are also essential in the fields of epidemiology and public health. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example from the Breast Cancer. The proposed approach consists of a knowledge base (ontology and instances) and several modules such as querying, reasoning, diagnosing, and recommending treatments. We made a primary evaluation to evaluate the diagnosing accuracy by entering information about a number of persons infected with Breast Cancer disease and evaluate the results. Also, we evaluate the recommending treatments according to a human expert oncology by comparing his recommended treatments of a patient with a doctor's prescription who treated that patient, then with the approach recommendations to that patient. The approach achieved a rate of accuracy in the results of diagnosing the Breast Cancer disease of 86%, a rate of accuracy in the results of the recommending treatments of 75%.},
