abstract: Mobile shopping (m-shopping) turns out to be exceptionally important for
  both retail-selling and marketing. Although for the past few years m-shopping has
  increasingly become an alternative approach to buying products, the consumer's expectation
  for high quality services is not clearly fulfilled yet. It is extremely significant
  to fully understand and analyze the factors which affect the acceptance of consumers
  for m-shopping, especially for the purpose of mobilizing the right strategies for
  the respective vendors. This literature review focuses on finding the factors that
  influence m- shopping that particularly reflect the consumers attitude and purchasing
  behavior in performing such kind of e-commerce activity. Our findings identify 20
  influencing factors that are considered important for improving the quality of services
  in m-shopping.
