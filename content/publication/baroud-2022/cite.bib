 abstract = {Mobile shopping (m-shopping) turns out to be exceptionally important for both retail-selling and marketing. Although for the past few years m-shopping has increasingly become an alternative approach to buying products, the consumer's expectation for high quality services is not clearly fulfilled yet. It is extremely significant to fully understand and analyze the factors which affect the acceptance of consumers for m-shopping, especially for the purpose of mobilizing the right strategies for the respective vendors. This literature review focuses on finding the factors that influence m- shopping that particularly reflect the consumers attitude and purchasing behavior in performing such kind of e-commerce activity. Our findings identify 20 influencing factors that are considered important for improving the quality of services in m-shopping.},
