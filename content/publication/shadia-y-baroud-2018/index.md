abstract: CBR is a reasoning paradigm that instead of relying on general rules or
  models chooses the specific knowledge contained into already solved instances of
  problems. The quality of case-based reasoning method depends primarily on a good
  representation of cases in the retrieve step and the richness of knowledge base.
  The basis for using the case-based reasoning process is to support the formalization
  of reasoning procedures for collaborative medical acts. We proposed an approach
  is to help resolving the difficulty of determining the best treatment for the disease
  and to get best practices. This research describes a model for knowledge engineering
  using the taxonomic reasoning of ontology modeling and semantic similarity to .
  In addition to being a valuable support in the procedure of medical decision making,
  this model can be used to strengthen significant collaborations and traceability
  that are important for the development of proper deployment of medical applications.
  Adequate mechanisms for information management with traceability of the reasoning
  are also essential in the fields of epidemiology and public health. The proposed
  approach is illustrated with an example from the Breast Cancer. The proposed approach
  consists of a knowledge base (ontology and instances) and several modules such as
  querying, reasoning, diagnosing, and recommending treatments. We made a primary
  evaluation to evaluate the diagnosing accuracy by entering information about a number
  of persons infected with Breast Cancer disease and evaluate the results. Also, we
  evaluate the recommending treatments according to a human expert oncology by comparing
  his recommended treatments of a patient with a doctor's prescription who treated
  that patient, then with the approach recommendations to that patient. The approach
  achieved a rate of accuracy in the results of diagnosing the Breast Cancer disease
  of 86%, a rate of accuracy in the results of the recommending treatments of 75%.
