 abstract = {Software Testing Ontology (STO) serves as a formal representation of the vocabulary to be used in descriptions pertaining to software testing knowledge area. The need for a standardized STO is crucial in making descriptions of various aspects of software testing body of knowledge and practices not only machine processable, but also can be done in a uniform way. This paper describes the steps we have used to build the base for the standard STO that, in turn, can be extended and further enhanced towards standardization. The evolving STO is envisioned to be an important addition towards enriching the functionality of semantic software testing tools and systems.},
