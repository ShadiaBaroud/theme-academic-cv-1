abstract: Software Testing Ontology (STO) serves as a formal representation of the
  vocabulary to be used in descriptions pertaining to software testing knowledge area.
  The need for a standardized STO is crucial in making descriptions of various aspects
  of software testing body of knowledge and practices not only machine processable,
  but also can be done in a uniform way. This paper describes the steps we have used
  to build the base for the standard STO that, in turn, can be extended and further
  enhanced towards standardization. The evolving STO is envisioned to be an important
  addition towards enriching the functionality of semantic software testing tools
  and systems.
