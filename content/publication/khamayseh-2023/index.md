abstract: Threats to information systems security have become very alarming with the
  present extensive growth in Internet use. As a response, intrusion detection systems
  have been created to provide defence mechanisms against various types of attacks
  such as those due to Ransomware, DdoS, Botnet, Trojans, Viruses, Spyware, Worms,
  and more. The use of a machine learning approach to develop smart intrusion detection
  systems to solve these types of problem have also been explored and this typically
  involves applying the various machine learning techniques that focus on the dataset
  collected by a network monitoring tool. This paper presents a study on the utility
  of three classification machine learning algorithms which are J48, Decision Stump,
  and Random Forest in detecting threats by comparing their accuracy and processing
  time when applied to the UNSW-NB15 dataset with the aim of discovering the best
  technique that can accurately spot the pattern of any suspicious activity in the
  network. The results of show that J48 exhibits the best combination of accuracy
  and processing time among the evaluated classification techniques on the employed
  dataset. Moreover, the study reveals that increasing the sample size of the dataset
  can enhance the precision of the model, although this enhancement might come at
  the expense of overall accuracy. Additionally, it emphasizes that the application
  of feature selection techniques alone does not necessarily lead to an improvement
  in accuracy.
